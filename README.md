# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor (Engineering Students)

This project predicts whether an engineering student is likely to **Pass** or **Fail** in a subject based on various academic and study-related inputs using a machine learning model.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Predicts student performance using Random Forest Classifier
- âœ… UI built using Streamlit
- âœ… Balanced dataset with `RandomOverSampler`
- âœ… Supports model retraining and saving
- âœ… Focused on key study-related features
- âœ… Visual feedback when a student is predicted to **Fail**
